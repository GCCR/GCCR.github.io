          <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Okay. Breathe. No reason to panic. Either you were working hard and typed a link wrong in haste, in which you can easily fix that now. Or, <a href="http://kwcooper.xyz" target="_blank">Keiland</a>, one of the site developers, was up late, and misconfigured a few links trying to pull this whole thing off. Let's be honest, this is the most likely case, and since the customer is always right, we'll go with that anyway.</h3>
