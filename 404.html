          <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Okay. Breathe. No reason to panic. Either you were working hard and typed a link wrong in haste, in which you can fix that now. Or, <a href="http://kwcooper.xyz" target="_blank">Keiland</a>, the site developer, was up late, and misconfigured a few links trying to pull this whole thing off. The later is the most likely case, and since the customer is always right, we'll go with that anyway. Please try another link above, and thank you for stopping by.  </h3>
