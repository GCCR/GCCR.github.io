                <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Introduction</h2>
                <p class="text-muted"> In response to anecdotal reports of the loss of smell and of taste in people who have tested positive for COVID-19, a group of international smell and taste researchers have united to study how, when and why this is happening and what it can tell us about the Coronavirus. </p>

                <p class="text-muted"> This inclusive group, called The Global Consortium of Chemosensory Researchers (GCCR), consists of open-science contributors: transdisciplinary scientists, clinicians, and patient advocates from all over the world. </p>

                <p class="text-muted">  Because the systems of smell and taste are related, so are the symptoms of loss of these senses. Yet the loss of the sense of smell after a virus, such as a common cold, affects many people, whereas the loss of the sense of taste is reported much less frequently. </p>

                <p class="text-muted"> The GCCR wants to know if smell loss is a frequent symptom of the Coronavirus and if it is accompanied by taste loss. </p>

                        <p class="text-muted"> The Global Consortium on Chemosensory Research (GCCR) has been started with the aim of uniting chemosensory scientists worldwide to understand reports of the chemosensory issues related to COVID-19. More broadly, the GCCR aspires to define, coordinate, and disseminate global efforts to advance the scientific understanding and clinical practice related to the chemical senses. </p>
