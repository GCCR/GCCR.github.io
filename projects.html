                      <h3> Research question &amp; prediction </h3>
                      <p>How prevalent is smell loss during COVID-19? Is COVID-19 related smell loss greater than smell loss due to other viral or respiratory illnesses? We predict that self-reported smell ability  for respondents with COVID-19 will be lower than that of respondents without illness or those with other viral or respiratory illnesses. </p>
                      
                      <h3> Contents </h3>
                      <p>This questionnaire includes items on smell, taste and chemesthesis function, as well as the collection of  information on COVID-19 diagnosis. We also ask about COVID-19 symptoms, other viral and respiratory illness symptoms, other medical conditions, smoking, and medicine use. This will allow us to draw conclusions about how important the reports of loss of smell are relative to other symptoms of COVID-19 and if reports of loss of smell can aid in distinguishing between COVID-19 and other illnesses. Collecting data globally has the advantage of a large sample size and a reduced influence of local factors.</p>

                    <p>The gold standard for taste and smell loss testing is done in clinics with extensive test batteries. Self-reporting taste and smell ability shows only moderate agreement with those objective tests. Under the current challenge of social distancing we are developing an at home taste and smell assessment protocol to have more sensitive data on changes in taste and smell ability over time, in particular during COVID-19. </p>
